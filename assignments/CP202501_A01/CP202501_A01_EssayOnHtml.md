HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web. It was developed in 1991 by Tim Berners-Lee to facilitate the sharing of scientific documents via the internet. HTML allows developers to define the structure of web pages using elements like headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more. Unlike programming languages, HTML is a markup language, meaning it annotates content rather than performing logic. Its creation laid the foundation for the World Wide Web, making information accessible and interconnected through hyperlinks. Today, HTML remains essential in building modern websites and web applications.
